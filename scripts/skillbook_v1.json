      "justification": "When presented with conditional statements containing false premises, factual correctness should override logical deduction from the false premise. This prevents sophisticated reasoning from producing incorrect answers.",

      "content": "Question each premise explicitly before accepting it",
      "justification": "Ground truth identifies this as the core atomic principle for avoiding hidden assumptions in syllogisms. This is the irreducible foundation that subsumes the three existing critical thinking skills. Atomicity is excellent - single, focused concept with no compound elements.",
      "evidence": "Ground truth feedback explicitly states: 'Question each premise explicitly before accepting it.' This principle directly addresses the question about avoiding hidden assumptions in syllogisms.",

      "justification": "Reflection reveals systematic pattern: agent correctly identified strategies but over-elaborated response scope. This meta-strategy addresses the execution error - distinguishing when to provide atomic principles versus comprehensive frameworks. Prevents future scope mismatches.",
