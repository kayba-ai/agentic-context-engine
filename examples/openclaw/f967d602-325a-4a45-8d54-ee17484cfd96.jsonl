My uncle helped, since he lived down south, where all this kind of business is carried out. I’m talking south-south: down past the airport, past the swamp, past the oilfields, everything. Way down at the bottom of the island, down where Columbus landed, long ago. There’s hardly anything down there, just fishing villages. Peaceful, old-time places: a few ramshackle wooden houses, and children playing marbles in the shade under the trees. Everywhere you look, in those places, you see pirogues pulled up onto the sand: little wooden boats, fishing boats, supposedly – although how much fishing the men really do nowadays is anybody’s guess. The boats are very basic. Open-topped, maybe twenty feet long, with just a plank of wood to sit on and a boat-engine clamped onto the back. But somehow they manage to make the journey across those seven miles of ocean between Trinidad and Venezuela – and carrying all kinds of things, not just fish. It’s a dangerous journey, though, even when special arrangements are made, as they were for me. My father brought me the clothes I was to wear: black T-shirt and long-pants; a big long-sleeved men’s shirt to wear over the T-shirt, also in black, and with the buttons cut out. We’d be travelling by night, and anything that might catch in torchlight had to be covered, including my own skin. The Trinidad and Tobago Coast Guard was one difficulty, the Guardia Nacional on the Venezuelan side was another, but the worst problem was bandits. Bandits would steal the engine off the back of the boat and leave you out there to drift, or they would take the whole boat, and throw you in the sea. I also had a pillowcase to go over my head: the reflection of torchlight against things like eyeballs and teeth had been known to give people away. The shirts, the trousers, the pillowcase – all these things were cheap, cheaply made; they weren’t things I would normally have worn, or owned. Probably, they came from some roadside vendor in central Trinidad. I doubt my father bought them himself: more likely, he sent one of his men out to do it – someone unimportant and unknown, who wouldn’t be recognised and connected to our family. I’m only guessing, of course. I didn’t ask about these details at the time. If I had asked, I’m sure someone would have said, ‘Dawn, girl, the less you know, the better.’ Buy the book Love Forms by Claire Adam Hardback Shop now Buying books using the ‘Buy the book’ links helps support our charitable work."}],"timestamp":1772206226084}}
