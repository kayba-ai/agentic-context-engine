# ACE Learned Strategies

These strategies have been automatically learned from coding sessions.
Apply relevant strategies based on the current task.

## Top Strategies (by effectiveness)
1. Read stdin before daemonization in forked processes (1↑ 0↓)
2. Delegate design research to Plan agents before implementation (1↑ 0↓)
3. Run py_compile and import tests after major changes (1↑ 0↓)
4. Create comprehensive plan documents before complex refactoring (1↑ 0↓)
5. Pause and research when implementation complexity increases unexpectedly (1↑ 0↓)
6. Verify CLI argparse changes with --help flag (1↑ 0↓)
7. Read file state before each Edit operation (1↑ 0↓)
8. Grep all references before removing constants (1↑ 0↓)
9. Use TodoWrite to track multi-step refactoring progress (1↑ 0↓)
10. Launch parallel research agents for multi-aspect design problems (1↑ 0↓)
